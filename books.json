    "description":"If you’re preparing to take the CEH exam, you’ll undoubtedly want to find as much information as you can about computers, networks, applications, and physical security. The more information you have at your disposal and the more hands-on experience you gain, the better off you’ll be when taking the exam. This study guide was written with that goal in mind—to provide enough information to prepare you for the test, but not so much that you’ll be overloaded with information that is too far outside the scope of the exam. To make the information more understandable, I’ve included practical examples and experience that supplements the theory.\n\n Author\n\nSean-Philip Oriyano",
