    "description":"Michael Miller has written more than fifty how-to and reference books over the last fifteen years, including Wiley’s Building Really Annoying Web Sites (2001). Mr. Miller has established a reputation for practical, real-world advice and an unerring empathy for the needs of his readers. He is known for his casual, easyto-read writing style and his ability to explain a wide variety of complex topics to an everyday audience. \nOf course, not all 501 secrets in this book will be new to you. If you’re Internetsavvy at all, you’ll probably know some of what I reveal in these pages. That’s okay; it only means that you’re on your toes. I’m sure, however, that you’ll find more than a few secrets you didn’t know, and that they’ll make this book a worthwhile read for you. ",

    "rating":"6.5",
    "description":"If you’re preparing to take the CEH exam, you’ll undoubtedly want to find as much information as you can about computers, networks, applications, and physical security. The more information you have at your disposal and the more hands-on experience you gain, the better off you’ll be when taking the exam. This study guide was written with that goal in mind—to provide enough information to prepare you for the test, but not so much that you’ll be overloaded with information that is too far outside the scope of the exam. To make the information more understandable, I’ve included practical examples and experience that supplements the theory.\n\n Author\n\nSean-Philip Oriyano",
